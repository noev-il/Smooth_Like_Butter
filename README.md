# Smooth_Like_Butter

## Project Overview

**Smooth_Like_Butter** is a project that helps users discover and create playlists where songs transition seamlessly. Users can select a starting song, find other tracks that flow into it, create transition chains, focus on specific genres, and generate a curated playlist.

## Key Features

1. **Song Selection**: Choose a starting track.
2. **Transition Finder**: Identify songs that transition smoothly.
3. **Chain Creation**: Build a series of smoothly transitioning tracks.
4. **Genre Focus**: Filter transitions by genre.
5. **Playlist Generation**: Create playlists with seamless transitions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Data Management**: JSON
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Analysis**: SciKitLearn, Pandas

## Development Timeline

- **08/16/2023**: Setup environment and started collaboration on GitHub.
